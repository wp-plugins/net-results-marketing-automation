This plugin enables Net-Results Marketing Automation across your entire WordPress blog/site in about 10 seconds.

== Description ==

Net-Results is the world's only segment-based marketing automation system. It tracks visitors as they interact with your website and allows you to launch drip/trigger/lead nurturing email campaigns that are fully tracked.

Net-Results features segment-based lead scoring, lead nurturing, alerts, reports, dashboards and automated list management. Net-Results comes with native integrations to Salesforce.com, SugarCRM, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Sage SalesLogix. Both REST and SOAP APIs are available.

Installing this plugin is exactly analogous to installing the plugin for Google Analytics. It places a few lines of javascript into the footer of every page of your site/blog and gathers essentially the same data that Google Analytics gathers. Rather than simply aggregating that data into analytical reports, Net-Results will show the specific actions of individual website visitors.

You can segment those visitors based on both traditional database marketing fields and behavioral fields such as number of pages viewed, visit duration and many more. When prospects qualify for a given segment Net-Results can alert you, send you a daily report, adjust a lead score, send an automated email to the prospect, add the prospect to a marketing list, schedule a call in your CRM and more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin into /wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Under the 'Tools'->'Net-Results Marketing Automation' menu, enter your PSID provided by your Net-Results account.
3. Click 'Save Changes'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is my PSID? =

It is an number that Net-Results assigns to you that uniquely identifies your account. 

= Can I get my PSID without contacting you? =

Yes, in the capture code that was emailed to you when the product was provisioned, you will find it starts something like this:

script id="__maSrc" type="text/javascript" data-pid="XXXX"

Where the number in data-pid is your PSID. Do not include the double quotes, and do not use XXXX - it must be a number.
